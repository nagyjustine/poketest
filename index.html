    <figcaption>A pink, round, derpy looking PokeMon, with a swirl for his hairdo and a giant tongue, complete with a round belly and yellow stripes and a curly tail stands.</figcaption></figure>
    <h2>Lickilicky</h2>
    <h3>#463</h3>
    <h3>Licking Pokémon</h3>
    <h4>Sinnoh Region</h4><br>
  </section>
  <div class="cardContainer">

    <h3>The best moves for Lickilicky are Lick and Hyper Beam when attacking Pokémon in Gyms.</h3><br>
     <p>This move combination has the highest total DPS and is also the best moveset for PVP battles.
      Lickilicky is a dark pink, rotund Pokémon with a small tail and a long tongue.</p> <h3>It has a yellow
      line pattern on its belly and a white bib-like pattern</h3><p>This makes it almost resemble a round 
      baby boy. It also has what appears to be a curled appendage on its head.</p>

    <h3>It has a big appetite. It can lick anything or anyone close by for any leftover crumbs</h3><br>
    <p>Its saliva contains a numbing solvent and can decompose anything, and it wraps its long tongue around
    things, like its prey, to coat them with its sticky saliva.</p>
    <h3>It has space in its throat to store saliva, and it can also roll up its tongue and store it there.</h3>
    <p>Lickilicky lives in forests with a large body of water. It uses its tongue with more skill than it would its 
    hands and feet, and a current record of its stretch length exceeds 82 feet.</p>
     <h3>Tongue can also function with the same dexterity as a human hand.</h3>  
     <p>However, Lickilicky is rather clumsy with its own fingers.</p>
